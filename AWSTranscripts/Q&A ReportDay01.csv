35,IaaS is clear but I am a bit confused b/w PaaS and SaaS.,Kunal Shah,'-,"PaaS provides a platform that allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. It typically includes development tools, middleware, and runtime environments. PaaS is beneficial for developers who want to focus on coding and application development rather than managing the infrastructure.

SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software through a web browser without worrying about installation, maintenance, or hardware requirements. SaaS is suitable for end-users who want a ready-to-use software solution without dealing with the technical details.",03/11/2024 12:43:47,03/11/2024 12:48:20,Skillsoft Bootcamp Admin 1,content.team@skillsoft.com
36,"In strategies for migrating to cloud, I believe AWS has added a 7th strategy called Relocating. Relocating
Relocating is often referred to as lift and optimize. In this approach, you move applications to the cloud without significant changes. However, once they're in the cloud, you might transition them to cloud-centered services.

For instance, after you relocate a database to the cloud, you might migrate from a hosted virtual machine (VM) to a managed database service. This provides some benefits of cloud-centered capabilities without extensive initial refactoring.",Roshni Poothakuzhiyil Abraham,'-,Thanks. Don't worry about that for this exam though.,03/11/2024 13:00:58,03/11/2024 13:49:42,Michael Shannon,michael.shannon@skillsoft.com
