01:47:52	Skillsoft Bootcamp Admin 1:	Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increasing workloads by adding resources, either vertically (upgrading existing hardware) or horizontally (adding more machines). Elasticity specifically involves the automatic and dynamic allocation or deallocation of resources based on demand, allowing for flexibility in scaling up or down in response to varying workloads.
