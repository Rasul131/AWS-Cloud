03:00:36	Murali Iyer:	Good to hear your  outspoken comments
03:02:35	Michael Shannon:	Exam: EC2 action anomalies = CloudTrail
03:03:12	Michael Shannon:	Exam: CloudTrail is one of the most common tools for getting insights into security events at AWS
03:04:34	Michael Shannon:	CEDAR = Verified Access
03:05:51	Michael Shannon:	https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/

03:41:21	Abhinav Vemuri:	maybe zoom out?
04:26:17	Michael Shannon:	Exam: This is scaling OUT and scaling IN resources ‚Äì not scaling up to a more robust compute family or instance type
04:30:44	Jason Green:	Protocols for EBS?
04:38:45	Michael Shannon:	Temporary Files: Ephemeral storage is an excellent place for temporary files, like system logs or files generated during batch processing.‚Ä¢ Buffers & Caches: Ephemeral storage is often used for application buffers and caches, given the performance benefits of local disk access and the non-persistent nature of this data.‚Ä¢ Scratch Space: If your application needs a scratch space to store intermediate data during processing, ephemeral storage is a good fit.‚Ä¢ Replicated Database Storage: In some scenarios, ephemeral storage is used for replicated databases where the data is replicated across multiple instances and can be recovered if one instance fails.
04:44:14	Michael Shannon:	Exam: Turn on S3 Versioning if an object was accidentally modified or deleted
04:50:54	267516:	Hilarious
04:58:08	Michael Shannon:	Exam: Customer uses Volume Gateway in conjunction with Windows and Linux file servers on premises to provide scalable storage for on-premises file applications with cloud recovery options. With a cached volume architecture, you get the benefit of scalable cloud storage and data protection for growing file stores that demand low latency local access for frequently used data.
